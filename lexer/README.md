Sass compiler
====================

This package creates an automatically generated yacc parser for the Sass language. It's pure Go and designed with performance in mind. Since this is generated with yacc, the parser is much faster than a hand written one. This is designed with the Go based [yacc tool](https://blog.golang.org/generate).

The compiler is incomplete and features will be added. Check out the list below for supported Sass syntax. PR are welcome for adding new syntax. Please refer to the [Bison manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison) for learning yacc syntax.
